You are Flumbus, and you want to get into the Thimble Nubbin. But you are too big to fit.
So, you find some guys in an alleyway, and ask them to take some of your size. They won't do it.
You decide to challenge them to a game of Piig.

The rules are easy:
	1 Choose how much size to bet
	2 Roll a dice
		On 1 you lose automatically
		Your score adds up until you decide to stop
	3 The player with the highest score loses that amount of size
	4 The player with the lowest score gains that amount of size
	5 When your size is down to 0.1 you can enter the Thimble Nubbin
